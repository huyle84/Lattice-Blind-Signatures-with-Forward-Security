 	abstract="The distribution of cryptographic keys has always been a major problem in applications with many users. Solutions were found for closed user groups and small open systems. These are, however, not efficient for large networks. We propose an identity-based approach to that problem which is simple and applicable to networks of arbitrary size. With the solution proposed, the user group can, furthermore, be extended at will. Each new user needs only to visit a key authentication center (KAC) once and is from then on able to exchange authenticated keys with each other user of the network. We expect this type of approach, which was originally conceived for authentication and signatures, to play an increasing role in the solution of all types of key distribution problems.",

	abstract="Electronic voting systems are created to facilitate the election, accelerate voting and counting votes and increase turnout for the election. The main problems of the electronic systems are related with the assurance of system security (cryptographic security and protection against frauds) and a guarantee that the voters are anonymous. The authorization of voters and the anonymity of them seem to be contradictory, but it is possible to create such a system where the both requirements are met. Some solutions, the most common e-voting systems, are presented in the paper. These models are adjusted to the demands and implemented in the polls system for quality of teaching evaluation where anonymity is very important. The blind signature protocol, model directed to user's anonymity, is a very good solution of the authorization and anonymity problem in the polls system with remote access only, as it was described in the paper.",

Previous examples of blind signature schemes were constructed from traditional signature schemes with only the additional proof of blindness. The design of some of the underlying signature schemes can be validated by a proof in the so-called random oracle model, but the security of the original signature scheme does not, by itself, imply the security of the blind version. In this paper, we first propose a definition of security for blind signatures, with application to electronic cash. Next, we focus on a specific example which can be successfully transformed in a provably secure blind signature scheme.",

This can be useful to mitigate the damage caused by key exposure without requiring distribution of keys. Our construction uses ideas from the Fiat-Shamir and Ong-Schnorr identification and signature schemes, and is proven to be forward secure based on the hardness of factoring, in the random oracle model. The construction is also quite efficient.",

It has gained wide interests in applications to ad hoc groups. We present a general construction of blind SAG 1-out-of-n and t-out-of-n signature schemes from essentially any major blind signature. In the case when our scheme is built from blind Schnorr (resp. Okamoto-Schnorr) signature, the parallel one-more unforgeability is reduced to Schnorr's ROS Problem in the random oracle model plus the generic group model. In the process of our derivations, we obtain a generalization of Schnorr's result [17] from single public key to multiple public keys.",

In this paper, a new type of blind signature schemes called fair blind signature schemes is proposed. Such schemes have the additional property that a trusted entity can deliver information allowing the signer to link his view of the protocol and the message-signature pair. Two types of fair blind signature schemes are distinguished and several realizations are presented.",

	abstract="Most lattice-based cryptographic schemes are built upon the assumed hardness of the Short Integer Solution (SIS) and Learning With Errors (LWE) problems. Their efficiencies can be drastically improved by switching the hardness assumptions to the more compact Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE problems. However, this change of hardness assumptions comes along with a possible security weakening: SIS and LWE are known to be at least as hard as standard (worst-case) problems on euclidean lattices, whereas Ring-SIS and Ring-LWE are only known to be as hard as their restrictions to special classes of ideal lattices, corresponding to ideals of some polynomial rings. In this work, we define the Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, which bridge SIS with Ring-SIS, and LWE with Ring-LWE, respectively. We prove that these average-case problems are at least as hard as standard lattice problems restricted to module lattices (which themselves bridge arbitrary and ideal lattices). As these new problems enlarge the toolbox of the lattice-based cryptographer, they could prove useful for designing new schemes. Importantly, the worst-case to average-case reductions for the module problems are (qualitatively) sharp, in the sense that there exist converse reductions. This property is not known to hold in the context of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE: Ideal lattice problems could reveal easy without impacting the hardness of Ring-SIS/Ring-LWE.",

This results in constructions of the most efficient to-date identification and signature schemes with security based on the worst-case hardness of problems in ideal lattices. In particular, our ID scheme has communication complexity of around 65,000 bits and the length of the signatures produced by our signature scheme is about 50,000 bits. All prior lattice-based identification schemes required on the order of millions of bits to be transferred, while all previous lattice-based signature schemes were either stateful, too inefficient, or produced signatures whose lengths were also on the order of millions of bits. The security of our identification scheme is based on the hardness of finding the approximate shortest vector to within a factor of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n^2){\$}in the standard model, while the security of the signature scheme is based on the same assumption in the random oracle model. Our protocols are very efficient, with all operations requiring {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n){\$}time.",

	abstract = "In this paper we exhibit several new classes of hash functions with certain desirable properties, and introduce two novel applications for hashing which make use of these functions. One class contains a small number of functions, yet is almost universal2. If the functions hash n-bit long names into m-bit indices, then specifying a member of the class requires only O((m + log2log2(n)) · log2(n)) bits as compared to O(n) bits for earlier techniques. For long names, this is about a factor of m larger than the lower bound of m + log2n − log2m bits. An application of this class is a provably secure authentication technique for sending messages over insecure lines. A second class of functions satisfies a much stronger property than universal2. We present the application of testing sets for equality. The authentication technique allows the receiver to be certain that a message is genuine. An “enemy”—even one with infinite computer resources—cannot forge or modify a message without detection. The set equality technique allows operations including “add member to set,” “delete member from set” and “test two sets for equality” to be performed in expected constant time and with less than a specified probability of error."

These tasks were previously the main bottleneck for a wide range of cryptographic schemes, and our techniques substantially improve upon the prior ones, both in terms of practical performance and quality of the produced outputs. Moreover, the simple structure of the new trapdoor and associated algorithms can be exposed in applications, leading to further simplifications and efficiency improvements.

We extend this idea to make the simulation trapdoors cancel not for a specific forgery but on a non-negligible subset of the possible challenges. Conceptually, we build a compactly representable, large family of input-dependent ``mixture'' lattices, set up with trapdoors that ``vanish'' for a secret subset which we hope the forger will target. Technically, we tweak the lattice structure to achieve ``naturally nice'' distributions for arbitrary choices of subset size. The framework is very general. Here we obtain fully secure signatures, and also IBE, that are compact, simple, and elegant.",

This results in a signcryption protocol that is more efficient than any combination of that signature with an El Gamal like encryption scheme.

	abstract={At present, several post-quantum cryptosystems have been proposed, and lattice-based cryptography is the main candidate. Especially in the direction of digital signatures, there are now many practical lattice-based signature schemes. However, there exist few lattice-based signatures with special property such as blind signature. Blind signature was introduced by Chaum for creating untraceable payment system. Then, it is widely used in e-cash and voting, especially in the revolutionary digital cash system based on blockchain. In our paper, we present a method to construct a post-quantum blind signature based on lattice assumptions, and we proved that any existential forger against the security of the resulting scheme can solve the SISq,n,m,βproblem for β = Õ(dn). Our main technique is the rejection sampling theory. The expected number of times needed to output a blind signature is at most e2under aborting, and our new scheme has much smaller signature size than those of all the previously proposed blind signature schemes over lattices.},

	abstract="Blind signatures (BS), introduced by Chaum, have become a cornerstone in privacy-oriented cryptography. Using hard lattice problems, such as the shortest vector problem, as the basis of security has advantages over using the factoring or discrete logarithm problems. For instance, lattice operations are more efficient than modular exponentiation and lattice problems remain hard for quantum and subexponential-time adversaries. Generally speaking, BS allow a signer to sign a message without seeing it, while retaining a certain amount of control over the process. In particular, the signer can control the number of issued signatures. For the receiver of the signature, this process provides perfect anonymity, e.g., his spendings remain anonymous when using BS for electronic money.",

	abstract="In this paper, we investigate a variant of the BKZ algorithm, called progressive BKZ, which performs BKZ reductions by starting with a small blocksize and gradually switching to larger blocks as the process continues. We discuss techniques to accelerate the speed of the progressive BKZ algorithm by optimizing the following parameters: blocksize, searching radius and probability for pruning of the local enumeration algorithm, and the constant in the geometric series assumption (GSA). We then propose a simulator for predicting the length of the Gram-Schmidt basis obtained from the BKZ reduction. We also present a model for estimating the computational cost of the proposed progressive BKZ by considering the efficient implementation of the local enumeration algorithm and the LLL algorithm. Finally, we compare the cost of the proposed progressive BKZ with that of other algorithms using instances from the Darmstadt SVP Challenge. The proposed algorithm is approximately 50 times faster than BKZ 2.0 (proposed by Chen-Nguyen) for solving the SVP Challenge up to 160 dimensions.",

We show that there is in fact a continuum of more efficient attacks between these two attacks. We show that by combining lattice reduction and a meet-in-the-middle strategy one can reduce the number of loops in attacking the NTRUEncrypt private key from 284.2 to 260.3, for the k{\thinspace}={\thinspace}80 parameter set. In practice the attack is still expensive (dependent on ones choice of cost-metric), although there are certain space/time tradeoffs that can be applied. Asymptotically our attack remains exponential in the security parameter k, but it dictates that NTRUEncrypt parameters must be chosen so that the meet-in-the-middle attack has complexity 2keven after an initial lattice basis reduction of complexity 2k.",

However, in 2011, Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld showed how to modify NTRUEncrypt to reduce security to standard problems in ideal lattices. In 2012, L{\'o}pez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

	abstract="In this paper, we describe a three-stage attack against Revised NSS, an NTRU-based signature scheme proposed at the Eurocrypt 2001 conference as an enhancement of the (broken) proceedings version of the scheme. The first stage, which typically uses a transcript of only 4 signatures, effectively cuts the key length in half while completely avoiding the intended hard lattice problem. After an empirically fast second stage, the third stage of the attack combines lattice-based and congruence-based methods in a novel way to recover the private key in polynomial time. This cryptanalysis shows that a passive adversary observing only a few valid signatures can recover the signer's entire private key. We also briefly address the security of NTRUSign, another NTRU-based signature scheme that was recently proposed at the rump session of Asiacrypt 2001. As we explain, some of our attacks on Revised NSS may be extended to NTRUSign, but a much longer transcript is necessary. We also indicate how the security of NTRUSign is based on the hardness of several problems, not solely on the hardness of the usual NTRU lattice problem.",

The techniques involve algorithmic algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, commutative algebra, and lattice basis reduction.

	abstract="In 1977 Dalenius articulated a desideratum for statistical databases: nothing about an individual should be learnable from the database that cannot be learned without access to the database. We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.",

	abstract = { Big data technologies are increasingly used for biomedical and health-care informatics research. Large amounts of biological and clinical data have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For example, the new generation of sequencing technologies enables the processing of billions of DNA sequence data per day, and the application of electronic health records (EHRs) is documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and analyzing biomedical data is expected to decrease dramatically with the help of technology upgrades, such as the emergence of new sequencing machines, the development of novel hardware and software for parallel computing, and the extensive expansion of EHRs. Big data applications present new opportunities to discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of health care. The application of big data in health care is a fast-growing field, with many new discoveries and methodologies published in the last five years. In this paper, we review and discuss big data application in four major biomedical subdisciplines: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical informatics, (3) imaging informatics, and (4) public health informatics. Specifically, in bioinformatics, high-throughput experiments facilitate the research of new genome-wide association studies of diseases, and with clinical informatics, the clinical field benefits from the vast amount of collected patient data for making intelligent decisions. Imaging informatics is now more rapidly integrated with cloud platforms to share medical image data and workflows, and public health informatics leverages big data techniques for predicting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. In this paper, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of big data applications in these health-care domains and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance big data applications in health care. }

In this paper, we show that for an LWR{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}m,n,q,p{\}}({\backslash}chi {\_}s){\$}{\$}instance whose parameters satisfy a certain sufficient condition, one can use the BDD strategy to recover the secret with higher advantages if one transforms the LWR instance to an LWE modulo {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}instance with {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}chosen appropriately instead of an LWE modulo q instance. The optimal modulus {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}used in our BDD attack is quite close to p as well as typically smaller than q. Especially, our experiments confirm that our BDD attack is much better in solving search-LWR in terms of root Hermite factor, success probability and even running time either in case the ratio {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log (q)/ {\backslash}log (p){\$}{\$}is big or/and the dimension n is sufficiently large.",

	abstract="Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool in cryptanalysis. In 2017, DeepBKZ was proposed as a new variant of BKZ, and it calls LLL with deep insertions (DeepLLL) as a subroutine alternative to LLL. In this paper, we develop a dual version of DeepBKZ (which we call ``Dual-DeepBKZ''), to reduce the dual basis of an input basis. For Dual-DeepBKZ, we develop a dual version of DeepLLL, and then combine it with the dual enumeration by Micciancio and Walter. It never computes the dual basis of an input basis, and it is as efficient as the primal DeepBKZ. We also demonstrate that Dual-DeepBKZ solves several instances in the TU Darmstadt LWE challenge. We use Dual-DeepBKZ in the bounded distance decoding (BDD) approach for solving an LWE instance. Our experiments show that Dual-DeepBKZ reduces the cost of Liu-Nguyen's BDD enumeration more effectively than BKZ. For the LWE instance of {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (40, 0.015){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(40,0.015)(resp., {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (60, 0.005){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(60,0.005)), our results are about 2.2 times (resp., 4.0 times) faster than Xu et al.'s results, for which they used BKZ in the fplll library and the BDD enumeration with extreme pruning while we used linear pruning in our experiments.",

The underlying cryptosystem serves as the equivalent of a ``hardware platform'' for HElib, in that it defines a set of operations that can be applied homomorphically, and specifies their cost. This ``platform'' is a SIMD environment (somewhat similar to Intel SSE and the like), but with unique cost metrics and parameters. In this report we describe some of the algorithms and optimization techniques that are used in HElib for data movement, linear algebra, and other operations over this ``platform.''",

To date, it remains the only known way of obtaining unbounded FHE. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is computationally very expensive, despite the great deal of effort that has been spent on improving its efficiency. The current state of the art, due to Gentry, Halevi, and Smart (PKC 2012), is able to bootstrap ``packed'' ciphertexts (which encrypt up to a linear number of bits) in time only quasilinear {\~O}($\lambda$) = $\lambda$ {\textperiodcentered} logO(1) $\lambda$ in the security parameter. While this performance is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors, the practical import is less clear: the procedure composes multiple layers of expensive and complex operations, to the point where it appears very difficult to implement, and its concrete runtime appears worse than those of prior methods (all of which have quadratic or larger asymptotic runtimes).",

One variant takes under over 36 hours to evaluate an entire AES encryption operation, using NTL (over GMP) as our underlying software platform, and running on a large-memory machine. Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block. We also detail a third implementation, which theoretically could yield even better amortized complexity, but in practice turns out to be less competitive.",

	abstract="In 2003, Schnorr introduced Random sampling to find very short lattice vectors, as an alternative to enumeration. An improved variant has been used in the past few years by Kashiwabara et al. to solve the largest Darmstadt SVP challenges. However, the behaviour of random sampling and its variants is not well-understood: all analyses so far rely on a questionable heuristic assumption, namely that the lattice vectors produced by some algorithm are uniformly distributed over certain parallelepipeds. In this paper, we introduce lattice enumeration with discrete pruning, which generalizes random sampling and its variants, and provides a novel geometric description based on partitions of the n-dimensional space. We obtain what is arguably the first sound analysis of random sampling, by showing how discrete pruning can be rigorously analyzed under the well-known Gaussian heuristic, in the same model as the Gama-Nguyen-Regev analysis of pruned enumeration from EUROCRYPT '10, albeit using different tools: we show how to efficiently compute the volume of the intersection of a ball with a box, and to efficiently approximate a large sum of many such volumes, based on statistical inference. Furthermore, we show how to select good parameters for discrete pruning by enumerating integer points in an ellipsoid. Our analysis is backed up by experiments and allows for the first time to reasonably estimate the success probability of random sampling and its variants, and to make comparisons with previous forms of pruned enumeration. Our work unifies random sampling and pruned enumeration and show that they are complementary of each other: both have different characteristics and offer different trade-offs to speed up enumeration.",

We introduce a new variant of the Blum, Kalai and Wasserman algorithm, relying on a quantization step that generalizes and fine-tunes modulus switching. In general this new technique yields a significant gain in the constant in front of the exponent in the overall complexity.

Our constructions are asymptotically efficient and highly parallelizable in a practical sense, i.e., they can be computed by simple, relatively small low-depth arithmetic or boolean circuits (e.g., in NC1 or even TC0). In addition, they are the first low-depth PRFs that have no known attack by efficient quantum algorithms. Central to our results is a new ``derandomization'' technique for the learning with errors (LWE) problem which, in effect, generates the error terms deterministically.",

We discuss techniques to accelerate the speed of the progressive BKZ algorithm by optimizing the following parameters: blocksize, searching radius and probability for pruning of the local enumeration algorithm, and the constant in the geometric series assumption (GSA). We then propose a simulator for predicting the length of the Gram-Schmidt basis obtained from the BKZ reduction. We also present a model for estimating the computational cost of the proposed progressive BKZ by considering the efficient implementation of the local enumeration algorithm and the LLL algorithm. Finally, we compare the cost of the proposed progressive BKZ with that of other algorithms using instances from the Darmstadt SVP Challenge. The proposed algorithm is approximately 50 times faster than BKZ 2.0 (proposed by Chen-Nguyen) for solving the SVP Challenge up to 160 dimensions.",

We show that there is in fact a continuum of more efficient attacks between these two attacks. We show that by combining lattice reduction and a meet-in-the-middle strategy one can reduce the number of loops in attacking the NTRUEncrypt private key from 284.2 to 260.3, for the k{\thinspace}={\thinspace}80 parameter set. In practice the attack is still expensive (dependent on ones choice of cost-metric), although there are certain space/time tradeoffs that can be applied. Asymptotically our attack remains exponential in the security parameter k, but it dictates that NTRUEncrypt parameters must be chosen so that the meet-in-the-middle attack has complexity 2keven after an initial lattice basis reduction of complexity 2k.",

	abstract="In 1996, Hoffstein, Pipher and Silverman introduced an efficient lattice based encryption scheme dubbed NTRUEncrypt. Unfortunately, this scheme lacks a proof of security. However, in 2011, Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld showed how to modify NTRUEncrypt to reduce security to standard problems in ideal lattices. In 2012, L{\'o}pez-Alt, Tromer and Vaikuntanathan proposed a fully homomorphic scheme based on this modified system. However, to allow homomorphic operations and prove security, a non-standard assumption is required. In this paper, we show how to remove this non-standard assumption via techniques introduced by Brakerski and construct a new fully homomorphic encryption scheme from the Stehl{\'e} and Steinfeld version based on standard lattice assumptions and a circular security assumption. The scheme is scale-invariant and therefore avoids modulus switching and the size of ciphertexts is one ring element. Moreover, we present a practical variant of our scheme, which is secure under stronger assumptions, along with parameter recommendations and promising implementation results. Finally, we present an approach for encrypting larger input sizes by extending ciphertexts to several ring elements via the CRT on the message space.",

	abstract="In this paper, we describe a three-stage attack against Revised NSS, an NTRU-based signature scheme proposed at the Eurocrypt 2001 conference as an enhancement of the (broken) proceedings version of the scheme. The first stage, which typically uses a transcript of only 4 signatures, effectively cuts the key length in half while completely avoiding the intended hard lattice problem. After an empirically fast second stage, the third stage of the attack combines lattice-based and congruence-based methods in a novel way to recover the private key in polynomial time. This cryptanalysis shows that a passive adversary observing only a few valid signatures can recover the signer's entire private key. We also briefly address the security of NTRUSign, another NTRU-based signature scheme that was recently proposed at the rump session of Asiacrypt 2001. As we explain, some of our attacks on Revised NSS may be extended to NTRUSign, but a much longer transcript is necessary. We also indicate how the security of NTRUSign is based on the hardness of several problems, not solely on the hardness of the usual NTRU lattice problem.",

The techniques involve algorithmic algebraic number theory, analytic number theory, commutative algebra, and lattice basis reduction. This sheds new light on the Gentry-Szydlo algorithm, and the ideas should be applicable to a range of questions in cryptography.",

	abstract="We present a new approach to the compression technique of Lyubashevsky et al. [17,13] for lattice-based signatures based on learning with errors (LWE). Our ideas seem to be particularly suitable for signature schemes whose security, in the random oracle model, is based on standard worst-case computational assumptions. Our signatures are shorter than any previous proposal for provably-secure signatures based on standard lattice problems: at the 128-bit level we improve signature size from (more than) 16500 bits to around 9000 to 12000 bits.",

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy.",

	abstract = { Big data technologies are increasingly used for biomedical and health-care informatics research. Large amounts of biological and clinical data have been generated and collected at an unprecedented speed and scale. For example, the new generation of sequencing technologies enables the processing of billions of DNA sequence data per day, and the application of electronic health records (EHRs) is documenting large amounts of patient data. The cost of acquiring and analyzing biomedical data is expected to decrease dramatically with the help of technology upgrades, such as the emergence of new sequencing machines, the development of novel hardware and software for parallel computing, and the extensive expansion of EHRs. Big data applications present new opportunities to discover new knowledge and create novel methods to improve the quality of health care. The application of big data in health care is a fast-growing field, with many new discoveries and methodologies published in the last five years. In this paper, we review and discuss big data application in four major biomedical subdisciplines: (1) bioinformatics, (2) clinical informatics, (3) imaging informatics, and (4) public health informatics. Specifically, in bioinformatics, high-throughput experiments facilitate the research of new genome-wide association studies of diseases, and with clinical informatics, the clinical field benefits from the vast amount of collected patient data for making intelligent decisions. Imaging informatics is now more rapidly integrated with cloud platforms to share medical image data and workflows, and public health informatics leverages big data techniques for predicting and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks, such as Ebola. In this paper, we review the recent progress and breakthroughs of big data applications in these health-care domains and summarize the challenges, gaps, and opportunities to improve and advance big data applications in health care. }

In this paper, we show that for an LWR{\$}{\$}{\_}{\{}m,n,q,p{\}}({\backslash}chi {\_}s){\$}{\$}instance whose parameters satisfy a certain sufficient condition, one can use the BDD strategy to recover the secret with higher advantages if one transforms the LWR instance to an LWE modulo {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}instance with {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}chosen appropriately instead of an LWE modulo q instance. The optimal modulus {\$}{\$}q'{\$}{\$}used in our BDD attack is quite close to p as well as typically smaller than q. Especially, our experiments confirm that our BDD attack is much better in solving search-LWR in terms of root Hermite factor, success probability and even running time either in case the ratio {\$}{\$}{\backslash}log (q)/ {\backslash}log (p){\$}{\$}is big or/and the dimension n is sufficiently large.",

	abstract="Lattice basis reduction is a strong tool in cryptanalysis. In 2017, DeepBKZ was proposed as a new variant of BKZ, and it calls LLL with deep insertions (DeepLLL) as a subroutine alternative to LLL. In this paper, we develop a dual version of DeepBKZ (which we call ``Dual-DeepBKZ''), to reduce the dual basis of an input basis. For Dual-DeepBKZ, we develop a dual version of DeepLLL, and then combine it with the dual enumeration by Micciancio and Walter. It never computes the dual basis of an input basis, and it is as efficient as the primal DeepBKZ. We also demonstrate that Dual-DeepBKZ solves several instances in the TU Darmstadt LWE challenge. We use Dual-DeepBKZ in the bounded distance decoding (BDD) approach for solving an LWE instance. Our experiments show that Dual-DeepBKZ reduces the cost of Liu-Nguyen's BDD enumeration more effectively than BKZ. For the LWE instance of {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (40, 0.015){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(40,0.015)(resp., {\$}{\$}(n, {\backslash}alpha ) = (60, 0.005){\$}{\$}(n,$\alpha$)=(60,0.005)), our results are about 2.2 times (resp., 4.0 times) faster than Xu et al.'s results, for which they used BKZ in the fplll library and the BDD enumeration with extreme pruning while we used linear pruning in our experiments.",

The underlying cryptosystem serves as the equivalent of a ``hardware platform'' for HElib, in that it defines a set of operations that can be applied homomorphically, and specifies their cost. This ``platform'' is a SIMD environment (somewhat similar to Intel SSE and the like), but with unique cost metrics and parameters. In this report we describe some of the algorithms and optimization techniques that are used in HElib for data movement, linear algebra, and other operations over this ``platform.''",

To date, it remains the only known way of obtaining unbounded FHE. Unfortunately, bootstrapping is computationally very expensive, despite the great deal of effort that has been spent on improving its efficiency. The current state of the art, due to Gentry, Halevi, and Smart (PKC 2012), is able to bootstrap ``packed'' ciphertexts (which encrypt up to a linear number of bits) in time only quasilinear {\~O}($\lambda$) = $\lambda$ {\textperiodcentered} logO(1) $\lambda$ in the security parameter. While this performance is asymptotically optimal up to logarithmic factors, the practical import is less clear: the procedure composes multiple layers of expensive and complex operations, to the point where it appears very difficult to implement, and its concrete runtime appears worse than those of prior methods (all of which have quadratic or larger asymptotic runtimes).",

One variant takes under over 36 hours to evaluate an entire AES encryption operation, using NTL (over GMP) as our underlying software platform, and running on a large-memory machine. Using SIMD techniques, we can process over 54 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just under 40 minutes per block. Another implementation takes just over two and a half days to evaluate the AES operation, but can process 720 blocks in each evaluation, yielding an amortized rate of just over five minutes per block. We also detail a third implementation, which theoretically could yield even better amortized complexity, but in practice turns out to be less competitive.",

The new reduction method samples short lattice vectors in high dimensional sublattices, it advances in sporadic big jumps. It decreases the approximation factor achievable in a given time by known methods to less than its fourth-th root. We further speed up the new method by the simple and the general birthday method.",

	abstract="In 2003, Schnorr introduced Random sampling to find very short lattice vectors, as an alternative to enumeration. An improved variant has been used in the past few years by Kashiwabara et al. to solve the largest Darmstadt SVP challenges. However, the behaviour of random sampling and its variants is not well-understood: all analyses so far rely on a questionable heuristic assumption, namely that the lattice vectors produced by some algorithm are uniformly distributed over certain parallelepipeds. In this paper, we introduce lattice enumeration with discrete pruning, which generalizes random sampling and its variants, and provides a novel geometric description based on partitions of the n-dimensional space. We obtain what is arguably the first sound analysis of random sampling, by showing how discrete pruning can be rigorously analyzed under the well-known Gaussian heuristic, in the same model as the Gama-Nguyen-Regev analysis of pruned enumeration from EUROCRYPT '10, albeit using different tools: we show how to efficiently compute the volume of the intersection of a ball with a box, and to efficiently approximate a large sum of many such volumes, based on statistical inference. Furthermore, we show how to select good parameters for discrete pruning by enumerating integer points in an ellipsoid. Our analysis is backed up by experiments and allows for the first time to reasonably estimate the success probability of random sampling and its variants, and to make comparisons with previous forms of pruned enumeration. Our work unifies random sampling and pruned enumeration and show that they are complementary of each other: both have different characteristics and offer different trade-offs to speed up enumeration.",

In addition, they are the first low-depth PRFs that have no known attack by efficient quantum algorithms. Central to our results is a new ``derandomization'' technique for the learning with errors (LWE) problem which, in effect, generates the error terms deterministically.",

abstract="Cryptographic computations are often carried out on insecure devices for which the threat of key exposure represents a serious and realistic concern. In an effort to mitigate the damage caused by exposure of secret data (e.g., keys) stored on such devices, the paradigm of forward security was introduced. In a forward-secure scheme, secret keys are updated at regular periods of time; furthermore, exposure of a secret key corresponding to a given time period does not enable an adversary to ``break'' the scheme (in the appropriate sense) for any prior time period. A number of constructions of forward-secure digital signature schemes, key-exchange protocols, and symmetric-key schemes are known.",

abstract="Group signature is a fundamental cryptographic primitive, aiming to protect anonymity and ensure accountability of users. It allows group members to anonymously sign messages on behalf of the whole group, while incorporating a tracing mechanism to identify the signer of any suspected signature. Most of the existing group signature schemes, however, do not guarantee security once secret keys are exposed. To reduce potential damages caused by key exposure attacks, Song (ACMCCS 2001) put forward the concept of forward-secure group signature (FSGS), which prevents attackers from forging group signatures pertaining to past time periods even if a secret group signing key is revealed at the current time period. For the time being, however, all known secure FSGS schemes are based on number-theoretic assumptions, and are vulnerable against quantum computers.",

pages="413--430",
abstract="Blind signatures (BS), introduced by Chaum, have become a cornerstone in privacy-oriented cryptography. Using hard lattice problems, such as the shortest vector problem, as the basis of security has advantages over using the factoring or discrete logarithm problems. For instance, lattice operations are more efficient than modular exponentiation and lattice problems remain hard for quantum and subexponential-time adversaries. Generally speaking, BS allow a signer to sign a message without seeing it, while retaining a certain amount of control over the process. In particular, the signer can control the number of issued signatures. For the receiver of the signature, this process provides perfect anonymity, e.g., his spendings remain anonymous when using BS for electronic money.",

abstract="A blind ring signature scheme is a combination of a ring signature and a blind signature, which allows not only any member of a group of signers to sign on a message on behalf of the group without revealing its identity but also the user who possesses the message to blind it before sending to the group to be signed. Blind ring signature schemes are essential components in e-commercial, e-voting etc. In this paper, we propose the first blind ring signature scheme based on lattices. More precisely, our proposed scheme is proven to be secure in random oracle model under the hardness of the short integer solution (SIS) problem.",

abstract="We provide an alternative method for constructing lattice-based digital signatures which does not use the ``hash-and-sign'' methodology of Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2008). Our resulting signature scheme is secure, in the random oracle model, based on the worst-case hardness of the {\~O}(n1.5)-SIVP problem in general lattices. The secret key, public key, and the signature size of our scheme are smaller than in all previous instantiations of the hash-and-sign signature, and our signing algorithm is also quite simple, requiring just a few matrix-vector multiplications and rejection samplings. We then also show that by slightly changing the parameters, one can get even more efficient signatures that are based on the hardness of the Learning With Errors problem. Our construction naturally transfers to the ring setting, where the size of the public and secret keys can be significantly shrunk, which results in the most practical to-date provably secure signature scheme based on lattices.",

Especially, it is more severe in the applications such as electronic cash or electronic payment where money is directly involved. Forward secrecy is one of the security notions addressing the key exposure issues. Roughly speaking, forward secrecy is aimed to protect the validity of all actions using the secret key before the key exposure. In this paper, we investigate the key exposure problem in blind signature (with an application to the electronic cash in mind) and propose a blind signature scheme which guarantees forward secrecy. Our scheme is constructed from the provably secure Okamoto-Guillou-Quisquater (OGQ for short) blind signature scheme. Using the forking lemma by Pointcheval and Stern [4], we can show the equivalence between the existence of a forger with the solvability of the strong RSA problem. Further we show that our scheme introduces no significant communication overhead comparing with the original OGQ scheme.",
